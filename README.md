# Malignant vs. Benign Image Classification

This repository hosts a machine learning project designed to classify images as malignant or benign, primarily in medical imaging applications.

## Project Overview

The project includes:

- **Dataset**: Utilizes a dataset comprising 13,000 training images and 1,000 testing images for model training and evaluation.
- **Model Training**: Trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify images as malignant or benign.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Achieves an accuracy of 82% on the testing dataset, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between malignant and benign cases.

## Validation with Additional Dataset

The model's performance is further assessed using an independent dataset consisting of 33,000 images. Here, the model achieves an accuracy of 85%, indicating its ability to generalize well across larger and diverse datasets.

## Key Features

- **Data Processing**: Preprocesses images to prepare them for model training, including resizing and denoising.
- **Model Architecture**: Employs a CNN architecture optimized for image classification tasks.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses accuracy as the primary metric to assess the model's performance.
